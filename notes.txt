# In this file, we list the formats for the scripts.
# For each episode, the format for how characters lines are formatted may be different.

# Furthermore, the format that denotes scene changes may also change.
# NOTE: The idea of a 'scene change' is a nebulous idea. Is a 'scene' the same location (potentially being filmed across multiple storylines)?
# E.g., Is showing multiple guards running around King's Landing a single 'scene'?
# In particular, Season 4 Episode 9, The Watch On the Walls, is set ENTIRELY at Castle Black.  Is this a single 'scene'? There are no marks to show a scene change or `cuts` for example.

# For character lines, the key is:
# "CHARACTER_NAME:" is where the the line is "CHARACTER NAME: <Line>"
# "**CHARACTER_NAME:**" is where the line is "**CHARACTER_NAME:** <Line>"


# For scenes, the key is:
# SCENE denotes that scene changes are marked with the words 'Scene shifts' or '## TITLE SEQUENCE'
# DASHES denotes that scene changes are marked with a row of '\- - - - -' OR a row of '\----'.
# STARS denotes that scene changes are marked with '* * *'.
# INT/EXT denotes that scene changes are marked with either the word 'INT' or 'EXT' (capitals) or use of the word 'Interior' or 'Exterior'. These words do not appear elsewhere.
# CUT denotes that scene scene changes are marked with the words 'CUT TO'.
# INT/EXT/CUT denotes that the scene changes are marked with 'INT' or 'EXT' or 'CUT TO'.
# ONE_SCENE denotes where the entire episode can be considered a single scene.


# Episode specific notes:
# s02e09 there are a lot of 'cuts' that may not strictly be a different scene. However I feel they're different enough to warrant it.
